## Dataset

* The Loan Data from Prosper Dataset is a dataset of loans taken between 2005 and 2013 from Prosper
* The dataset contains 113,937 rows (loans) with 81 columns (loan variables) on each row
* The loan variables consist of qualitative (ordinal and nominal) and quantitative features
* In this exploratory analysis, we will be seeking to find insights on the relationships between the various loan variables e.g. 
> * Borrower's APR, Prosper Score, Income Range, Debt to Income Ratio, Employment Status, Stated Monthly Income, Loan Year, and Employment Duration

The main features of interest (response variables) in the dataset include:
> * Borrower's APR
> * Prosper Score
> * Debt to Income Ratio 

The variables that will support the investigation of the variables of interest are known as predictor features. The following predictor feautures will be used in the exploration:
> * Income Range
> * Employment Status
> * Stated Monthly Income
> * Loan Year
> * Employment Duration 



## Summary of Findings

### Findings from Univariate Exploration

Borrower APR
* The distribution of Borrower APR is largely multimodal, with small peaks around 0.1 and 0.3. There is a large peak around 0.2
* The unusual points noted in the Borrower APR are the big steep peak around 0.35

Loan Original Amounts
* The distribution of Loan Original Amounts is multimodal, with big peaks at around USD 5000, USD 10000, and USD 15000
* The distribution is also right skewed, with the majority of the Loan Original Amounts being lower than USD 30,000

Income Range
* Majority of the borrowers have an Income Range of USD 25k - 50k and USD 50k - 75k (Middle Class). This implies that Middle Class group are the greatest loan takers
* The least of the borrowers are in the group of USD 1 - 25k, "Not Employed", and USD 0
* This implies that the Unemployed and Low Income earners are at a lesser chance of being given loans; as compared to the Middle Class earner's

Employment Status
* The majority of the Borrowers have an Employment Status of "Employed"
* Conversely, the least proportion of Borrowers are in the "Other",, "Part-time", "Not employed", and "Retired" employment statuses
* This implies that lenders are more likely to give loans to employed persons, due to the security associated with employment 

Debt to Income Ratio
* The histogram is skewed right, implying that the majority of the debt to income ratios lay between 0 and 0.4
* This implies that lenders pay keen attention to ensure a borrower can service the loan, by ensuring that their debt-to-income ratio is low

The unusual distributions I noted include:
* There is a small irrecognizable difference between distributions of loan takers who are home-owners and those who are not. 
> * This is contrary to the fact that home-owners are more likely to be given loans as compared to those who are not; as there is more security assured with the lending

* There is also a great discrepancy between the distributions of Stated Monthly Income and Income Range. 
> * Majority of the borrowers have an Income Range of USD 25k - 50k; while majority of borrowers have a Stated Monthly Income of below USD 20k. 
> * The two variables are closely related, hence their distributions should not be counter-intuitive
